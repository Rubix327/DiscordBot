# Discord Bot - "Bamboni"

The plan is to create a multifunctional Discord bot with functions such as playing music, posting memes and answering some stupid questions to server's users.

Version 1.0:
-
- **Created bot**
- **Added few events**: bot ready event, user's join on server event, user's remove from server event
- **Added few commands**: testMe, 8ball (magicball), ping, clear, kick, ban, unban

Version 1.1:
-
- **Added bot status**
- **dded some commands**: members, calc, changeStatus
- **Added DM greeting as user joins a server**
- **Bot token and guild token are transfered to .env file so now you can't hack me**
